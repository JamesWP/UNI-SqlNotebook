# general points
more technical not personal

not too specific needs to be general

no reference to "i" until after the project in reflection

---

# Introduction
  set the scene

  explain the problem with example of things that the end user might need

  so my proposal is ...

    bang bang bang statement here

  explain the project in more detail how exactly it will help the user overcome the problems that they are encountering

  what they can do with my project that they cant do with current solutions

  explain situation

# Background
  identify problems and the workflow these people are dealing with day to day, some typical scenarios

  identify current solutions on the market for this. identify problems with the current solutions and how they help the users to

  unsupported workflow within the tools they currently use

# Requirement
  formalize requirements based on the problems in background

  list requirements in formal form here

    explain requirement for solution, explain
    why this is important and how important
    it is to the problem

# Design
  ideas on how to realise the requirements
  identify curent solutions to some of the problems and how these will be used / not used in the project
  IPython
  hard design ideas diagrams etc..

# Implementation
  weigh up alternatives and evaluate different how to implement notebook
  reactjs framework,
  mapping of requirements and high level design / logiccal design to code constructs
