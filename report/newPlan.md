# Abstract
  With a typical developer role there are many workflow problems to solve. Outlined in this document is one possible solution to the problem of organizing all the required pieces of information required.
  This is a problem for developers because they are often working on multiple projects concurrently and can be required to switch in an instant.

  I will deal with the development of Sql server applications specifically. For the world of a Sql server developer there are many things that need to be remembered in order to complete a task: tables names, relations, column names / types.

  This paper outlines a plan to design and implement a tool to aid the developer of a Sql server database project by helping to store, organize, and search all the documents and code related to the database project.

# Introduction
  set the scene

  explain the problem with example of things that the end user might need

  so my proposal is ...

    bang bang bang statement here

  explain the project in more detail how exactly it will help the user overcome the problems that they are encountering

  what they can do with my project that they cant do with current solutions

  explain situation

  explain overview of the document

# Background
  identify problems and the workflow these people are dealing with day to day, some typical scenarios

  Developer has multiple ongoing projects, back burner project for excess time, personal project, main project.

  However disruptions can happen at any time, for example interruption from a support job on an older project. i.e. there is an issue with a report generating incorrect results. Must switch to project that hasn't been worked on in possibly months. Developer needs access to the high level overview of the system to narrow down the issue raised. Once the issue has been identified the solution needs to be tested and then the fix needs documenting for the next developer to pick up.

  This problem is not a new one and so there are many different ways to solve the problem. Below are some tools and a brief Introduction and explanation of how they help and fail to help a developer.

  Identify current solutions on the market for this. **identify problems** with the current solutions and how they help the users to complete tasks.

    Problems will be identified here

  The common issue that makes this problem hard is that it is an unsupported (constantly changing) workflow within the tools they currently use. **identify problems**

# Requirements
  Formalize requirements based on the problems in background

  list requirements in formal form here

    explain requirement for solution, explain
    why this is important and how important
    it is to the problem

# Design
  ideas on how to realise the requirements
  identify curent solutions to some of the problems and how these will be used / not used in the project
  IPython
  hard design ideas diagrams etc..

# Implementation
  weigh up alternatives and evaluate different how to implement notebook
  reactjs framework,
  mapping of requirements and high level design / logiccal design to code constructs

## Testing the project
