Abstract

Developers deal with many project and these are often vary intricate and can vary greatly in design and function. The details of these projects have to be understood by the developers in order to complete their job.
This project's aim is to create a tool that will help SQL developers to organize the information for their projects in a way that is integrated tightly with the development.

This document is a report that aims to identify the existing solutions and their problems and then offer solutions in a new project. If successful the project should result in a useful, easy to use, intuitive way to organize the code and information for SQL application developers.
