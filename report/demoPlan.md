## Intro

  My project is a browser based IDE development environment for aiding sql server developers

  It seeks to help document as well as write code.
  There is functionality to aid searching and relating content together with the goal of making context switching between projects less painful for the developer.

---

# Use cases

```
Users:  developers
Language: SQL server T-SQL
Role: Development / Maintaining old projects
```
  * Finding information about old projects
  * Comparing correct (old) results with new (broken) results
  * Documenting changes / decisions

Requirements
- the application must store code and information about the project the developer is working on
- the application must be able to store information about several projects
- the application must be able to be searched to quickly find all references to a term
- the application should be simple and easy to use for a user i.e. not require explanation of features. (pay for what you use)
- the application must allow for previous results / versions to be archived for future reference of past changes and comparison.
- the application should try to make it easy to see the relations (links) between the different stored information in the system.
- the application should try to make intuitive visual display of results.

---

## Demo / Use-case
- show opening of project in system
- show finding of document along with editing and history features.
- *you are now interrupted* cue alarm noises
- show finding of other project and searching for issue text.
- show opening of previous saved results and comparison with current results.
- show editing of procedure / view
- show re run of results to check fix
- show documentation of changes made
- show continuation of work on original project

---

## highlights of implementation / design
- diagrams
- high level system design / data flow diagram
- technology explanation
- learning demonstrated (extent of new things)

---

## testing the project
- unit testing the code
- startup tests
- simple operation of the system can validate Requirements

---

## supporting material
- extra diagrams
