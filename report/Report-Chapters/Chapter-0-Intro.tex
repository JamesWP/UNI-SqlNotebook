    Developers deal with many projects and these are often vary intricate and
    can vary greatly in design and function. The details of these projects have
    to be understood by the developers in order for them to complete their job.
    This project's aim is to create a tool that will help SQL developers to
    organize the information for their projects in a way that is integrated
    tightly with the development.

    This project aims to produce a new tool for SQL developers. A combined note
    and IDE tool. If successful the project should result in a useful, easy to
    use, intuitive way to organize the code and information for SQL application
    developers.
