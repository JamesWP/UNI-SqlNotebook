   Developers require an understanding of the task at hand in order to do their job. 
   Sometimes this information comes from documentation, other times it comes from
   code and comments. Having separated code and documentation means developers have to
   read and update two sets of information.
   This duplication of effort can lead to mistakes especially when switching between 
   code and notes. The goal of the project is to create a tool in which both the code and the 
   documentation can coexist and solve some of the problems that can occur when 
   using existing solutions.

    This project was developed at the University of Manchester, I would like
    to thank my tutor Alvaro for his help and support throughout all of
    these years and for his patience through the lengthy discussions on
    those occasions where my understanding needed expanding.

    Thanks also goes to my patient editors, my dad Anthony and my friend George.
