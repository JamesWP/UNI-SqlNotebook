    Developers deal with many project and these are often vary intricate and
    can vary greatly in design and function. The details of these projects
    have to be understood by the developers in order to complete their job.
    This project's aim is to create a tool that will help SQL developers to
    organize the information for their projects in a way that is integrated
    tightly with the development.

    This document is a report that aims to identify the existing solutions
    and their problems and then offer solutions in a new project. If
    successful the project should result in a useful, easy to use, intuitive
    way to organize the code and information for SQL application developers.
