Tutorial 2

MVP Agreed

The metaphor was agreed
  Notebook
    Tabs
      Types:- Content | Result | Interactive
      Examples:- "Scripts", "Test Cases"

Other notes for future implementation:-
  - if a peice of content is runnable, there is an action associated to run it
  - if a peice of context is an outcome of executing other content then you
    should be able to bind to bind it, or view the code that created it (if 
    links exist between them)
  - when you have code, running it created the outcome object and then a link 
    is created between them, changes to one or the other can be linked back 
    and allow for updating.
    * the link can be broken and this is then a historical output or script
      with no curent link
  - "all" the content is indexed, if it exists there will be a method to search
    for it and find it again
  - history needs to be visible for all actions and previous outputs of queries
  - there will be a set of display modes (extendable) that will detect output 
    in a form and display it into the window in the custom format
    * pie charts
    * hirachy
    * tables 
      etc...
  

Stuff for next week:
  - MVP
    * UI partial
    * code execution and results view
    * code execution api first
    * notebook interface
