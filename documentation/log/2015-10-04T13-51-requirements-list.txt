Requirements for the project:


The interface needs to be Web based.

The interface should store all required files for remote access so any browser
can be used anywhere.

The focus for all operations will be Project oriented. when a project is opened
the primary database and all supporting databases on the server will be opened
and all else will be hidden (reduce clutter).

For each project (usually single database) there will be a collection of
scripts stored for easy access and manipulation. These scripts will allow
the developer to view the previous actions performed.

When a developer needs to accomplish a task, all the things he has done are
automatically ( or easily ) saved into the history of the project to aid future
reference.

Frequently executed statements and there results can be viewed on the screen
and updated with ease.

Results for frequent queries can have there results shown in different ways
so as a list or a grid or pie charts etc.

When looking into a table, filters will be easily applied and related records
in other tables will be easily viewed. ( via foreign keys )

When a result contains an xml type result there will be integrated tools to
edit the document and save it back. ( cutently this is acheived by opening a
new window to view the document, and to save the resulting xml is copied into 
an UPDATE statement )

When creating a new procedure, an existing procedure signature can be picked 
as a template.

When developing, it is usefull to have a quick reference to the definition of
some tables. this would be a good use of extra screen space.
